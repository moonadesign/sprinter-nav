# Sprint Date Rules

- Sprint date ranges are inclusive of the end date
- Federal holidays are excluded from sprint workdays
- First sprint of the year starts on Jan 2 (after New Year's Day)
- Sprint workday count should match the actual number of non-holiday weekdays
- Last week of each quarter is an off week (Q1 Off Week, Q2 Off Week, etc.)
- Include all sprints in planning, even end-of-year sprints
- Off weeks should be included in sprint numbering/tracking
- Off weeks should list their dates in the days array even though they are non-work days
- Sprint nicknames should reflect holidays and events that occur during the sprint
- Theme sprint names and emojis around holidays or events that occur during the sprint
- Sprints must be continuous - no gaps between quarters or after off weeks
- Keep commit messages concise to prevent GitHub truncation

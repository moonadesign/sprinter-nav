# Sprint Date Rules

- Federal holidays are excluded from sprint workdays
- First sprint of the year starts on Jan 2 (after New Year's Day)
- Federal holidays include both the holiday and any officially observed days
- Holiday exclusions do not apply during off weeks since all days are non-working
- Sprint date ranges are inclusive of the end date
- Holiday rules do not apply during off weeks since those days are already non-working days
- Sprint workday count should match the actual number of non-holiday weekdays
- Last week of each quarter is an off week (Q1 Off Week, Q2 Off Week, etc.)
- Include all sprints in planning, even end-of-year sprints
- Off weeks should be included in sprint numbering/tracking
- Off weeks should list their dates in the days array even though they are non-work days
- Sprint nicknames should reflect holidays and events that occur during the sprint
- Theme sprint names and emojis around holidays or events that occur during the sprint
- Sprints must be continuous - no gaps between quarters or after off weeks
- Keep commit messages concise to prevent GitHub truncation
- Always include knowledge files in commits when they've been updated
- Each sprint contains explicit days array of YYYY-MM-DD strings instead of calculating dates
- When parsing YYYY-MM-DD strings with new Date(), add 'T00:00:00' to ensure consistent local timezone interpretation

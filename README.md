The original goal for this was to generate a script that could deterministically generate a list of sprints including dates and durations while accounting for holidays. But after a couple hours of banging my head, I have decided to just do a static version of this by simply requesting it from the LLM and so I will just document the prompts used, and that will be our deterministic method for v1.
